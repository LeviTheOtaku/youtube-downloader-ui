To use this you need to download youtube-dl.exe (https://youtube-dl.org/) and ffmpeg.exe (https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) and have them in the same folder as the YTDL.exe which you can find in releases.

This was made for music. It grabs metadata and cover art from the thumbnail and automatically converts into mp3.
